# Our Story ‚Äì How Python Togo Began

At the heart of Lom√©, Togo, a spark was lit ‚Äî not with fire, but with code.  
This is the story of **Python Togo**, a community born from passion, fueled by resilience, and driven by the belief that Python can change lives and transform an entire tech ecosystem.

## Humble Beginnings

It all started back in 2022 when Wachiou BOURAIMA joined the Microsoft Student Ambassadors program. Through this experience, he discovered the power of learning in community, mentorship, networking, and the transformative impact of volunteering.

Attending both local and international events ‚Äî online and in-person ‚Äî opened his eyes to what a strong developer community could achieve. While some may say volunteering doesn‚Äôt pay, we believe it builds something far more valuable: **growth, knowledge, and connection.**

By 2023, Togo‚Äôs tech scene was growing rapidly. Developer communities were emerging across campuses, sparking friendships and collaborations that would lay the groundwork for what was to come. Events like DevFest Lom√©, TDevFest, Tech Communities Day, MLSA Togo Meetups became meeting points for leaders who shared a common dream: building something bigger together.

Then came 2024 ‚Äî the year everything changed.

## The Turning Point: PyCon Africa 2024

When financial aid applications for PyCon Africa 2024 opened, we saw an opportunity. We shared it widely, and many from Togo applied. Only five received support ‚Äî but we refused to let that limit us.

So we did what any strong community would do: **we stepped up together.** Some members contributed financially, others reached out through networks. Thanks to Julius Boakey from PyClubs UG / Python Ghana, several of our members received vouchers. For transport and accommodation, we pooled resources so more people could attend.

The result? A life-changing experience in Accra. We met PSF Directors Deb Nicholson, Ex Director David Mertz, Python community founders Many and Michael Young Python Ghana, Kafui Alordo Python Ho, Steve Yonkeu and organizers from around the world Samson Gody, Ditiro Rampate. And amid the conversations, workshops, and late-night chats, one idea took root:

> Why not bring this energy back home?

And just like that, **Python Togo** was born.

## PyDay Togo 2024 ‚Äì Our First Big Step

Inspired by PyCon Africa, we organized **PyDay Togo 2024**, also known as *PyCon Africa Extended Togo 2024*. We expected about 50 attendees.

We got over **200**.

That number told us everything we needed to know: there was a hunger for Python, for community, and for growth in Togo. And we were ready to answer that call.

## PyCon Togo 2025 ‚Äì Building Something Greater

Now, we‚Äôre preparing for **PyCon Togo 2025** ‚Äî our most ambitious project yet. This time, we want to do things right: better equipment, stronger organization, and inclusive access for participants from all corners of Togo and beyond.

This isn‚Äôt just another tech event. It‚Äôs the beginning of a movement ‚Äî one that empowers developers, educates students, and creates opportunities where they matter most.
